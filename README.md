## WFD-import
A batch import of European water data based on the Water Framework Directive
reporting.

To run it you will have to install `wikidata-stuff` using:
`pip install git+https://github.com/lokal-profil/wikidata-stuff.git`

*Note*: You might have to add the `--process-dependency-links` flag to the above
command if you are running a different version of pywikibot from the required one.

### Note
This repo was split of from 
[lokal-profil/wikidata_batches](https://github.com/lokal-profil/wikidata_batches)
so the history might be a bit mixed up.
